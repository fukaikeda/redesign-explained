            <h2>Redesign of <b>Kathy's Driving School</b></h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                While searching for a driving school, I found it difficult to read websites and find a service that appealed to me.  
                Applying my knowledge of user interfaces, I identified key usability issues that hindered the user experience.  
                Therefore, I decided to redesign a webpage to improve accessibility and navigation, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.

            <h2>The Original Website</h2>

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The original website I chose for this redesign is <a href="https://kathysdrivingschool.com/" target="_blank">Kathy's Driving School</a>.  
                When attempting to book a session, I noticed several usability issues, including unnecessary animations and unclear navigation.

            <h2>Accessibility and Usability Issues</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Through my analysis, I identified the following key issues with the website:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Efficiency:</b> Booking a session is difficult because users must select a location before viewing the calendar. This is frustrating for users who prioritize availability over location.</li>
                <li><b>Comparing Prices:</b> Users cannot compare prices easily, which may be intentional but negatively impacts decision-making.</li>
                <li><b>Learnability:</b> Service descriptions are unclear; the site immediately directs users to pricing and booking pages instead of explaining the offerings.</li>
                <li><b>Payment Procedure:</b> The payment process lacks transparency, making it hard for users to understand how to complete transactions.</li>
                <li><b>Memorability:</b> The site contains multiple links leading to different calendars with inconsistent UI, making navigation confusing.</li>
                <li><b>Conceptual Model:</b> The site's icons and banners do not correspond to their content, causing disorientation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Web Accessibility Audit</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Using <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">WebAIM WAVE</a>, I evaluated the accessibility of the website. Key findings include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Alt text is provided for images, which is good practice. However, the descriptions are not informative enough for screen readers.</li>
                <li>Some text elements have low contrast, making readability difficult for users with visual impairments.</li>
                <li>Several form inputs are missing labels, making it challenging for screen reader users to interact with them.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To improve accessibility, I recommend adding detailed alt text, enhancing text contrast, and ensuring all form inputs have clear labels.

            <h2>Redesign Goals</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                My primary goal is to make the website more user-friendly, ensuring users can:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Swiftly navigate and find relevant information.</li>
                <li>Easily compare pricing and services.</li>
                <li>Understand the booking and payment processes without confusion.</li>
                <li>Experience an accessible and visually clear interface.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Style Guide</h2>

        </div>
            <p class="paragraph">
                To ensure a cohesive and accessible design, I developed a style guide focusing on readability, consistency, and user experience. The redesign adopts a clean and modern aesthetic based on the original theme.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The primary color palette consists of high-contrast colors based off the Rhode Island licsense plate to enhance readability, particularly for users with visual impairments. I selected an Arial typeface for its legibility.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Elements, such as buttons and graphs, follow a consistent design pattern to improve usability. Additionally, I implemented a responsive layout, allowing seamless adaptability across different screen sizes.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                This style guide ensures that the redesigned website maintains both visual appeal and accessibility, aligning with modern web design best practices.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Through this project, I gained valuable insights into usability issues and accessibility challenges.  
                By implementing a structured redesign, I aimed to enhance user experience, making the website more efficient, learnable, and inclusive for all users. <br>
                <br>
                Key improvements to the website include removal of unnecessary dynamic components, restructure of important functionality like booking sessions, and an overall more consistent design.
                By implementing a modern color palette and a basic font, the website has a cleaner look as well as a higher legibility.
                This experience furthered my appreciation for a good design and developed my practical skills in improving accessibility.
