            <h2>Redesign of <b>Kathy's Driving School</b></h2>
            <p class="paragraph">As I was browsing different websites
                to find a driving school, I found it very difficult to
                read websites and find a service I was pulled too.
                Connecting my knowledge about interfaces, I identified 
                some key issues in the usability of these webpages.
                Therefore, I decided to redesign a webpage for better
                user experience, with careful attention to how the screen
                looks on different devices.
